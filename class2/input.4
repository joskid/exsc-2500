the data learn python

Learn Python programming in preparation for an introduction to
machine learning.  No previous programming experience is required,
but learners must have enough computer and algebra skills to complete
the "Problem Solving, Programming, and Video Games" (PVG) massive
open online course (MOOC) hosted on Coursera.  In a flipped classroom
format, PML 1 is a supplement to the PVG MOOC with in-class exercises
and Q and A, but the MOOC will *not* be taught in class.  After PML
1 and PML 2, learners will be able to program and understand basic
machine-learning concepts and algorithms.
